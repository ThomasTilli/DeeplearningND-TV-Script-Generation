# DeeplearningND-TV-Script-Generation

In this project, we generate your own Simpsons TV scripts using RNNs. We be using part of the Simpsons dataset of scripts from 27 seasons. The Neural Network you'll build will generate a new TV script for a scene at Moe's Tavern. We be using a subset of the original dataset. It consists of only the scenes in Moe's Tavern. This doesn't include other versions of the tavern, like "Moe's Cavern", "Flaming Moe's", "Uncle Moe's Family Feed-Bag", etc.

We build a RNN to generate a new script.
